
August 2015 Facility templates: addition to my original set

   Put the folder "Gilly" into /mods/resources/ruins along with the biome folders, merge with existing Gilly folder if exists

   Files with "Facility" in name are the main ones used in /generic folder



<<<<<List of templates with basic descriptions>>>>>


 (leave a copy of everything in the Gilly folder, as most are called by another template)
  Files marked with "Modded" in name use Tinkers Construct and Chisel2


---* <<<place copies of these files in /generic folder>>>

  * GillyFacilitySkyport       (tech-themed underground launchpad/mining base)
  * GillyModdedFacilitySkyport (version of above with mod blocks)
  * GillyModdedFacilityHangar  (tech-themed underground cargo hangar)
  * GillyTreeStumpOak          (huge rotted-out tree stump using oak logs and mushroom blocks)
  * GillyFort                  (weathered stonebrick wall, parkour entrance top with fence and slabs)
  * GillyFoodFort              (same as above with farm in center)

Templates in the /Gilly folder spawn only if called from another template in /generic (or /templateparser or a biome folder)
Keep a copy of ALL files in the Gilly folder, this is where they need to be when called by an active template

   Put nothing in /templateparser, only for testing.

   Use in worlds at own risk: if removing files from active directories, restart minecraft to clear from memory


All files have "Gilly" to ensure a unique filename when merged with other content
