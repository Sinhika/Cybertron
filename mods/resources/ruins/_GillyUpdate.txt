To install:  
   Place all the folders in mods/resources/ruins/

Note there are duplicate files for a few structures, ones with "Modded" in title use blocks from other mods (Tinkers Construct and Chisel2)
One or the other duplicate file can be removed from the "/generic" folder, depending on if you are playing with those specific mods in addition to Ruins
Keep all files in the "/Gilly" folder, it is an archive that active templates seek when calling support files.

Modified only two files in this last update:

GillyModdedFacilityReactor
GillyHangarCargo

-----  Aug 20 2015

Replaced lines in templates that broke in newest versions of Ruins.

Set up the file structure for templates, makes it easy to install considering the number of files has grown over time.

Included new files for my Reactor Facility:
   GillyModdedFacilityReactor
   GillyModdedReactorAccess
   GillyModdedReactorCore

  This is the first time I've completed the version of a structure using mod blocks before the vanilla version.
Since it's a reactor it really only makes sence to have the mod-block version, tell me what you think.
